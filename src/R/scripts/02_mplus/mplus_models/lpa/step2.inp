! Two latent profiles specified, based on results of original iterative modeling process.
AUXILIARY = SCS;
! Now, covariates are included in the AUXILIARY statement so that they will be included in the 
! datafile outputted by the SAVEDATA command at the bottom of the syntax file.
MISSING ARE .;
ANALYSIS:
TYPE=MIXTURE;
! STARTS=10000 500;
! Added increased number of starts for each step of the ML estimation in response to message 
! about possible convergence issue noted in output

MODEL:
%OVERALL%
! Want to run the model that was decided upon through the enumeration phase.
! For a default Mplus model the LPA model does not need to be specified. However, it can be. 
! The model can also be modified from the Mplus default of estimating the indicator means 
! (uniquely across profiles) and variances (constrained across profiles), as well as the latent 
! profile mean. The syntax below specifies the Mplus defaults.

!This statement makes sure that the weights of the indicators for each of the profiles. The bch 
!weights are based upon the “Classification Probabilities for the Most Likely Latent Class 
!Membership (Column) by Latent Class (Row)”. These are used in the next modeling step to 
!specify the profiles so that they are not affected by the inclusion of the covariates in the model.
