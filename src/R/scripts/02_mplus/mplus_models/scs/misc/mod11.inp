MISSING ARE ALL (-999); !Change the indicator of your missing values if not -999

!Tip: If Mplus gives an error that it is unable to expand a certain set of variables
!when running the ESEM code then identify that range of variables in the
!usevariables list and move them to another position in the usevariables list (e.g. top).

ANALYSIS:
ESTIMATOR=MLR; !Other estimators are also possible, such as MLR.
PROCESSORS=6; !Replace 8 with the number of logical processors of your CPU and remove !
!STARTS=20; !Convergence problems? Attempt different starting values. Remove ! to enable.
!STITERATION=50000; !Use with STARTS function when your model fails to converge.
ROTATION=TARGET (orthogonal); !Use if factors are theoretically and

MODEL:

! (*1) indicates that an exploratory model involving your variables will be requested.
! (~0) indicates that the non-intended cross-loadings are constrained to be as close
! as possible to zero.

!Global factor - other factors automatically uncorrelated with G by default.
G by
SCSK5-SCOI24 (*1); !Global factor added -remaining factors automatically uncorrelated with G by default.

POS BY
SCSK5-SCMI22
SCSJ1-SCOI24~0 (*1);

NEG BY
SCSJ1-SCOI24
SCSK5-SCMI22~0 (*1);

OUTPUT:
stdyx;
tech4;
!mod(10); !Remove the ! infront of mod to request modification indices.
