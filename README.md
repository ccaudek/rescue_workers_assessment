# Self-compassion: One construct or two?

This folder contains the data and the scripts for changing the statistical analyses in order to respond to the criticisms of the reviewers provided by the submission to Mindfulness.

## Where are the data?

The cleaned data with all items and all subscales, for the three groups, are stored in 

`here("data", "processed", "all_items", "three_samples_items_final.Rds")`

In this dataset, the values of the IES-R items have been translated (because they were too extreme), but only for the control group. 

For the SEM analysis, it is necessary to clean some more the data of the RW group.
