The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003b) is an established and commonly used self-report measure of the supportive attitude toward oneself when experiencing suffering. Despite frequent use in psychological research and established associations with psychological disorders, the factor structure and the scoring of the SCS are still debated. By examining previously published SCS factor structures and the external validity of the SCS, this study sought to determine whether self-compassion can be interpreted as a domain-specific construct. A sample of 782 rescue workers (58% female) between 18 and 71 years of age (M = 39.5, SD = 13.4) was compared to a community sample of 338 participants (47% female) between 18 and 74 years of age (M = 37.97, SD = 15.48). We related the SCS latent variables to measures of post-traumatic growth, post-traumatic stress, coping strategies, and personality dimensions. In the rescue-workers group, we found no evidence of a latent variable that may represent a global measure of self-compassion, indicating that the use of the SCS total score is inappropriate for individuals sharing the characteristics of the present rescue-workers sample. Instead, the SCS subscales (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification) are more informative of the components of self-compassion and are recommended for use in future research with individuals suffering from compassion fatigue or in clinical contexts. We discuss practical implications of these findings for the interpretation of self-compassion.
