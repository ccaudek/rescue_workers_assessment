RW show effects of burned-out

This is alleviated by several protective factors and aggravated by risk factors.

One aspect of the resilience of RW is SC, which has not previously beed studied in the larger context of protective and risk factors.

PURPOSE: 

1. establish whether SC is compromised in RW as compared to a control group.
2. use LPA to distinguish different profile of personality, outcome, risk and protective factors for RW; determine whether SC is differently compromised for the different profiles.
3. establish whether these different profiles interact with the specific work of RW in determining SC.
